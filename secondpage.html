  <p>
    I’ve always found the stock market fascinating because it reflects both innovation and psychology. Some companies stand out to me not only for their financial potential but also because of what they represent in terms of disruption and technology. 
    Below are a few stocks that I follow closely: Robinhood (HOOD), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Archer Aviation (ACHR).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Robinhood (HOOD)</strong> — I like Robinhood because it made investing accessible for everyone. The platform’s mission of democratizing finance resonates with me, and I think their expansion into retirement accounts and credit products has solid growth potential.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Palantir (PLTR)</strong> — Palantir is a data powerhouse. Their government and AI-driven analytics are at the center of modern decision-making. I believe their Foundry platform gives them a huge edge as more businesses adopt AI-based tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong> — Tesla is more than a car company; it’s a movement toward cleaner energy. The company’s innovations in autonomous driving and battery tech make it one of the most exciting long-term plays in the market. Its volatility makes it high-risk, but the innovation makes it worth watching.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Archer Aviation (ACHR)</strong> — Archer is working on electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and I think urban air mobility could be the next big transportation revolution. Their partnerships and progress toward FAA certification show real promise for the future of aviation.
  </p>

  <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>HOOD:</strong> Disruptive fintech platform bringing investing to everyone</li>
    <li><strong>PLTR:</strong> Big data and AI company with growing commercial adoption</li>
    <li><strong>TSLA:</strong> Leader in EV and energy storage innovation</li>
    <li><strong>ACHR:</strong> eVTOL company shaping the future of short-distance travel</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These stocks represent different corners of innovation — finance, AI, clean energy, and aviation — and that variety keeps me interested in following their progress every week.
